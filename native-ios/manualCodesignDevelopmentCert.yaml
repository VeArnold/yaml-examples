# Prerequisites:
# a) valid iOS development certificate
# b) valid iOS provisioning profile (with added devices)
# c) if using XCODE_WORKSPACE - a .xcworkspace file in the root of your iOS folder

# FILL-IN GUIDE:
# CM_CERTIFICATE: download your certificate from the Apple Developer Portal, add to your keychain, export as .p12 or .p8,
# encrypt the file in Codemagic UI and paste in the value to to the yaml.
# CM_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD: this is the password you set to the certificate while you're exporting it,
# go ahead and copy/write the password into the UI encryption tool and paste the encrypted value to the yaml.
# CM_PROVISIONING_PROFILE: this can also be retrieved from the Apple Developer Portal under profiles, download the
# developer profile that matches your bundle id (or create one) and encrypt the file in the UI and paste it into the yaml.
# XCODE_WORKSPACE: this is simply the name of your .xcworkspace, thus for example: appname.xcworkspace.
# XCODE_PROJECT: this can be defined instead of XCODE_WORKSPACE, to use your appname.xcodeproj file instead.
# NB! If you decide to use .xcodeproj instead of .xcworkspace, please also modify the build-ipa script accordingly.
# XCODE_SCHEME: this is your xcode scheme/target name, which by default most likely is your app name.
