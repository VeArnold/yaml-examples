# Prerequisites:
# a) access to App Store Connect -> Users and Access -> Keys
# b) devices added to your Apple Developer Account

# FILL-IN GUIDE:
# APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID: App Store Connect -> Users and Access -> Keys -> Issuer ID (format: 35f1fg2-5abe-17cd-9d15-3fd7g62d7a4a)
# APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER: App Store Connect -> Users and Access -> Keys (+ to add new key) -> key ID once process completed
# NB! When generating a new key choose either Developer or App Manager access.
# APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY: Download the previously created key in App Store Connect -> Users and Access -> Keys -> Download API Key
# after you've downloaded the key, open it up in any of your editors, and copy the CONTENT of the key to the Codemagic encryption tool
# make sure that you include the entire document, including -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END PRIVATE KEY-----, once encrypted
# go ahead and paste the value into the yaml.
# CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY: generate a new key locally using: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -f ~/Desktop/codemagic_private_key -q -N ""
# after the key has been generated, copy the entire CONTENT of the file (codemagic_private_key), including -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- and
# -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- and the following empty line into the Codemagic encryption tool and paste the encrypted value into the yaml. 
# XCODE_WORKSPACE: this is simply the name of your .xcworkspace, thus for example: appname.xcworkspace.
# XCODE_PROJECT: this can be defined instead of XCODE_WORKSPACE, to use your appname.xcodeproj file instead.
# NB! If you decide to use .xcodeproj instead of .xcworkspace, please also modify the build-ipa script accordingly.
# XCODE_SCHEME: this is your xcode scheme/target name, which by default most likely is your app name.
